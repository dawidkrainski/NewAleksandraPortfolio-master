        "description": "The design assumption was to create a residential house for a youngcouple. It has: kitchen, work space, bedroom (antresol), bathroom andsmall wardrobe. The whole house and its equipment is monochrome. It isblue. The exception is a wooden table with two chairs. They are to referto the family home, memories and childhood. The entire facade is glazedso that as much light as possible gets inside. The facade has one moretask. Interior and exterior integration - the user goes outside with thefunctions of the house. It is to be an intuitive desire to be close tonature. Equipment also has a purpose. When no resident uses any of thezones - they are closed or hidden. When he wants to use them - he opensthem. The kitchen has an additional worktop hidden in the wall, and inthe apparent wardrobe and place of relaxation is hidden desk in the closet towork on the computer.. When the user wants to work, he moves the chairfrom the kitchen to the second room and works there. It is also possibleto continue it elsewhere. Just open the terrace door and go from thework area to the mini terrace. The house has a single-fall roof. It ischeaper and easier to make. You can also collect rainwater and use itfor work, e.g. in the garden (axonometry). A large number of windowswill allow home insulation. By respecting nature, the project uses lessmaterial. One piece of furniture has several functions."

The program of the workshops will be prepared in such a way that its participants together with the guest designer could together create the idea of a small studio where each of them a full role. The space will be designed this way, so that users can feel comfortable in it.",

Route the design process from idea to design has the task of to make the child feel as important as the real one designer. In this way it should result in improved self-esteem, common integration, development of sensitivity and free creation even in the youngest."

        "description": "The coffee table I designed was created with the idea of incorporating it into a selected living space. It is a living room in a 17th century Catalan house in Spain. The whole object is made of natural stone with different textures. The design assumption for the table was primarily form and function. Because of the cubature of the chosen room I've decided to design two tables, which after joining together create a common whole. The shape is supposed to refer to the simplified form of natural stone, that's why the edges of the tables are led in a delicate arc, and the ash wood and matte black painted steel legs I used refer to the contrasting features of the house which are rawness, softness and delicacy."

The main design assumption was to enable the user to arrange the seats in their own creative arrangement. The collection of modular seats perfectly develops children's imagination, teaches creativity and cooperation. The collection consists of three basic modules of the same form and different heights: 30/40/45 cm. Stable seats are upholstered with high quality material (fabric Ballagie velvet col. 07, 19, 23).",
        "subDescription": "The body of the seat was inspired by natural forms of nature like a cone shape. It is made up of repetitive elements which, despite the increasing scale, form a complex, interesting form. Seat heights are varied for ergonomic reasons. They are designed for both children and adults. That is why DROP modular seats are comfortable and adapted for everyone. Thanks to the profiled shape, which is based on two circles, the seats can be combined with each other depending on the needs, creating many interesting compositions."

It is a specialized place where there are books, audiobooks, publications and albums, exclusively on the subject of botanical. The botanical reading room with its colors and form has the task of relaxing and silencing. A purposeful procedure of setting the seats has the task of creating additional comfort for the reader, so that everyone can find a place for themselves. The main inspiration for the project were analysis of plant structures under a microscope. Their organic form directed me to design a space with liquid, wavy and light character. The interiors are filled with fabrics starting from the floor to the seats in contrast to the metal tubes in the colors of nature. They create a form in which they are finding places for books."
